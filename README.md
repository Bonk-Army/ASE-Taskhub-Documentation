## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application "TaskHub". It includes an overview about this project and its vision, detailed information about the planned features and boundary conditions of the development process.

### 1.2 Scope
The project is going to be realized as an Web-Application.

### 1.5 Overview
The following chapter provides an overview of this project with vision and Overall Use Case Diagram. The third chapter (Requirements Specification) delivers more details about the specific requirements in terms of functionality, usability and design parameters. Finally there is a chapter with supporting information.

## 2. Overall Description
[This section of the SRS should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements.  This section does not state specific requirements.  
Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand. Include such items as:
 - product perspective
 - product functions
 - user characteristics
 - constraints
 - assumptions and dependencies
 - requirements subsets]

### 2.1 Vision
to be determined (tbd)

### 2.2 Use Case Diagram
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unk3wn/TaskHub---Documentation/main/UML/TaskHubUML.png">](UML)

### 2.3 Technology Stack
Backend : Node.Js
API : RestAPI
Frontend : Angular

## 3. Specific Requirements
[This section of the SRS should contain all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, 
and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.   When using use-case modeling, these requirements are captured in the Use-Cases and the applicable 
supplementary specifications.  If use-case modeling is not used, the outline for supplementary specifications may be inserted directly into this section, as shown below.]

### 3.1 Functionality
This section will explain the different use cases, you could see in the Use Case Diagram, and their functionality.
